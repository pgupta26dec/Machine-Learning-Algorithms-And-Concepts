# Machine-Learning-Algorithms-And-Concepts

This repository consists of my notes and implementations of various machine learning algorithms and concepts.

## Machine learning models covered:
1. Support Vector Machine (Support vector regressor pending)
2. Decision trees(To do)
3. Regression analysis : Linear, polynomial, bayesian, ridge, lasso, logistic (To-do)

## Concepts covered:
1. Principal component analysis (to-do)
2.
